#Introduction
##This RMarkdown document uses Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on 190 ranked countries along with educational data as a basis for analyzing and comparing a variety of economic and educational factors within and across countries. 

#Data Notes
##GDP data was obtained from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv. 
##Educational data data was obtained from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv. Each of these data sources was downloaded to a PC locally. The data sets were modified in Microsoft Excel to include only the data and "human readable" variable/header names. The GDP data variable names were updated to: "CountryCode", "Ranking", "Economy", "US_Dollars", respectively. For the education data, no changes were made to the variable names. All other information contained in the Microsoft Excel file was removed. Additionally, a blank column was removed between the variable columns: "Ranking" and "Economy" and a blank row was removed between the lowest ranked country, i.e. "Tuvalu" and the non-ranked country: "American Samoa". Missing values in the "Ranking" variable were left as a "blank space" and missing values in the "US Dollars" variable were updated with a "blank space" instead of the ".." value. Both files were saved as "gdp_data" and "education_data" locally as .csv files to the cloned Github repository: https://github.com/eshaw1/CaseStudyUnit6. 
##For the GDP Data, rankings include only those economies with confirmed GDP estimates. Several notes regarding economies of specific countries includes:
###a. Morocco economy includes Former Spanish Sahara.  
###b. Sudan economy excludes South Sudan.  
###c. Tanzania economy covers mainland Tanzania only. 
###d. Cyprus economy includes data for the area controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.   
###e. Georgia economy excludes Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  
###f. Moldova economy excludes Transnistria.

##Getting SessionInfo for run
sessionInfo()

##Reading in "GDP" and "Education" .csv file
gdp<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Earl\\Documents\\CaseStudyUnit6\\gdp_data.csv", header = TRUE)

##Determining the dimensions of the "gdp" data set; 214 rows, 4 columns
dim(gdp)

##Reading in "Education" .csv file
education<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Earl\\Documents\\CaseStudyUnit6\\education_data.csv", header = TRUE)

##Determining the dimensions of the "education" data set; 234 rows, 31 columns
dim(education)

##Merging GDP and Education data sets together using the country shortcode
gdp_educ <- merge(gdp, education, by="CountryCode")
#Question #1: Match the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match? --> 210 ID's match

##Determining the number of missing values for the "GDP Rank" variable
#Loading the "plyr" package to use the "count" function
##library(plyr) --> Not using currently
##count(gdp_educ,"Ranking") --> Not using currently

##Determining the number of missing values for the "US_dollars", "Income.Group" variable
na_ranking<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(Ranking))
dim(na_ranking)
na_dollars<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(US_dollars))
dim(na_dollars)
na_income_group<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(Income.Group))
dim(na_income_group)
##count(gdp_educ,"US_dollars")-->not using currently
##count(gdp_educ,"Income.Group")-->not using currently

##Removing rows with missing values for "GDP Rank"
gdp_educ_2<-subset(x=gdp_educ,Ranking!="NA")

##Double checking to be sure missing values were removed from the data set
na_ranking_2<-subset(gdp_educ_2,is.na(Ranking))
dim(na_ranking_2)
##count(gdp_educ_2,"Ranking") --> Not using currently
##count(gdp_educ_2,"US_dollars") --> Not using currently

##Determining the dimensions of the merged data set with missing values removed, i.e. "gdp_educ_2""; 189 rows, 34 columns
dim(gdp_educ_2)

##Sorting the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank
sort_gdp_educ_rank <- gdp_educ_2[order(-gdp_educ_2$Ranking),]
#Question #2: Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank (so United States is last). What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame? --> St. Kitts and Nevis is the 13th country

##Determining the the average GDP Ranking by the variable "Income.Group"
aggregate(Ranking~Income.Group,gdp_educ_2,mean)
#Question #3: What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" groups? -->High income: OECD=32.97; High income: nonOECD=91.91

#Loading "ggplot" library to provide additional functions for plotting data
library(ggplot2)
plot(gdp_educ_2$Income.Group,gdp_educ_2$US_dollars)
#Question #4: Plot the GDP for all countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group. ??

##Cutting the GDP Ranking into 5 separate quantile groups.
gdp_educ_cuts<-cut(gdp_educ_2$Ranking,breaks=c(1,40,80,120,160,190),labels=c("Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q5"))

##Creating a table using the cuts versus Income.Group
table(gdp_educ_cuts,gdp_educ_2$Income.Group)
#Question #5: How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP? --> 6

#Conclusion: In this exercise, it was determined that High Income OECD countries rank the highest in regards to GDP.
