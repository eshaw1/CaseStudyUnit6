#Introduction
##This RMarkdown document uses Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on 190 ranked countries along with educational data as a basis for analyzing and comparing a variety of economic and educational factors within and across countries. 

#Data Notes:
##GDP data was obtained from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv. 
##Educational data was obtained from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv. Each of these data sources was downloaded to a PC locally. The data sets were modified in Microsoft Excel to include only the data and "human readable" variable/header names. The GDP data variable names were updated to: "CountryCode", "Ranking", "Economy", and "US_dollars", respectively. Additionally, the "US_dollars" column was formatted as "General" in Microsoft Excel while other variable formats were left unchanged. All information except the variables and the associated data for each was removed. For the education data, no changes were made to the variable names. All other information contained in the Microsoft Excel file except for the variables and the associatted data was removed. Additionally, a blank column was removed between the variable columns: "Ranking" and "Economy" and a blank row was removed between the lowest ranked country, i.e. "Tuvalu" and the non-ranked country: "American Samoa". Missing values in the "Ranking" variable were left as a "blank space" and missing values in the "US_dollars" variable were updated with a "blank space" instead of the ".." value. Both files were saved as "gdp_data" and "education_data" locally as .csv files to the cloned Github repository: https://github.com/eshaw1/CaseStudyUnit6. 
##For the GDP Data, rankings include only those economies with confirmed GDP estimates. Several notes regarding economies of specific countries includes:
###a. Morocco economy includes Former Spanish Sahara.  
###b. Sudan economy excludes South Sudan.  
###c. Tanzania economy covers mainland Tanzania only. 
###d. Cyprus economy includes data for the area controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.   
###e. Georgia economy excludes Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  
###f. Moldova economy excludes Transnistria.

##Getting SessionInfo for run
sessionInfo()

##Reading in "GDP" and "Education" .csv file
gdp<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Earl\\Documents\\CaseStudyUnit6\\gdp_data.csv", header = TRUE)

##Determining the dimensions of the "gdp" data set; 214 rows, 4 columns
dim(gdp)

##Reading in "Education" .csv file
education<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Earl\\Documents\\CaseStudyUnit6\\education_data.csv", header = TRUE)

##Determining the dimensions of the "education" data set; 234 rows, 31 columns
dim(education)

##Merging GDP and Education data sets together using the country shortcode
gdp_educ <- merge(gdp, education, by="CountryCode")

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Question #1: Match the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match? --> 210 ID's match
##---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Determining the number of missing values for the "GDP Rank" variable
#Loading the "plyr" package to use the "count" function
##library(plyr) --> Not using currently
##count(gdp_educ,"Ranking") --> Not using currently

##Determining the number of missing values for the "US_dollars", "Income.Group" variable
na_ranking<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(Ranking))
dim(na_ranking)
na_dollars<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(US_dollars))
dim(na_dollars)
na_income_group<-subset(gdp_educ,is.na(Income.Group))
dim(na_income_group)
##count(gdp_educ,"US_dollars")-->not using currently
##count(gdp_educ,"Income.Group")-->not using currently

##Removing rows with missing values for "GDP Rank"
gdp_educ_2<-subset(x=gdp_educ,Ranking!="NA")

##Double checking to be sure missing values were removed from the data set
na_ranking_2<-subset(gdp_educ_2,is.na(Ranking))
dim(na_ranking_2)
##count(gdp_educ_2,"Ranking") --> Not using currently
##count(gdp_educ_2,"US_dollars") --> Not using currently

##Creating new data frame with only variables needed
gdp_educ_3 = subset(gdp_educ_2,select=c(CountryCode,Ranking,US_dollars,Income.Group))

##Determining the dimensions of the merged data set with missing values removed, i.e. "gdp_educ_3""; 189 rows, 34 columns
dim(gdp_educ_3)

##Sorting the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank
sort_gdp_educ_rank <- gdp_educ_3[order(-gdp_educ_3$Ranking),]

##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Question #2: Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank (so United States is last). What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame? --> St. Kitts and Nevis is the 13th country
##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Determining the the average GDP Ranking by the variable "Income.Group"
aggregate(Ranking~Income.Group,gdp_educ_3,mean)

##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Question #3: What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" groups? -->High income: OECD=32.97; High income: nonOECD=91.91
##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Loading "ggplot" library to provide additional functions for plotting data
library(ggplot2)
#Determining average GDP by Income.Group
gdp_by_group<-aggregate(US_dollars~Income.Group,gdp_educ_3,mean)
#Plotting average GDP by Income Group; "y-axis" units are in "$, Million".
ggplot(gdp_by_group,aes(x=Income.Group,y=US_dollars))+geom_point(aes(x=Income.Group,color=Income.Group))

#Creating new variable: "US_dollars_2"
gdp_educ_3[["US_dollars_2"]]<-gdp_educ_3$US_dollars/1000000
##Plotting GDP by Income.Group-"x-axis" units are in $, Trillion
ggplot(gdp_educ_3,aes(x=US_dollars_2,y=Income.Group))+geom_point(color="blue")

##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Question #4: Plot the GDP for all countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.
##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Cutting the GDP Ranking into 5 separate quantile groups.
gdp_educ_cuts<-cut(gdp_educ_3$Ranking,breaks=c(1,40,80,120,160,190),labels=c("Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4","Q5"))

##Creating a table using the cuts versus Income.Group
table(gdp_educ_cuts,gdp_educ_3$Income.Group)

##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Question #5: How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP? --> 6
##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Conclusion: In this exercise, it was determined that High Income OECD countries rank the highest in regards to GDP. All together, average GDP is ~$379B, the lowest GDP is $40M, median GDP is ~$28.2B, while the highest GDP is ~$16.2T. Interestingly, average GDP in the "Lower Middle Income" group is slightly higher than in the "Upper Middle Income" group. While the High Income groups, i.e. "OECD" vs "Non-OECD" differ by ~$1.3T, a striking contrast.
